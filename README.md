# Vulnerability-Management-and-Remediation-in-AWS-Cloud-Environment

involved leveraging Datadog and Orca for advanced querying and visualization to analyze high alerts from the vulnerability scanner across various AWS services, GitHub repositories, and IAM configurations. Each vulnerability was categorized based on type and severity, including misconfigurations, unused roles, and container vulnerabilities, with specific CVEs identified. Use cases were developed for each vulnerability to highlight security risks and their implications. Proactive monitoring and real-time alerting were implemented within Datadog and Orca to address new vulnerabilities promptly, facilitating timely incident response. Collaboration with cross-functional teams was essential for remediation, including patching, configuration changes, and resource isolation to enhance overall security posture.
